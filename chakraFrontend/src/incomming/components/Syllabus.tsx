      <h2>Assessment and Grading</h2>
      <h3>How do you earn your grade?</h3>
      <p>
        Grading will be on a mix of the percentage of points available for
        discussion board (class participation), assignments, quizzes and tests,
        team participation. See the Grade Table below for the grade point
        equivalents.
      </p>
      <h3>What are the rules about late work?</h3>
      <p>
        With the exception of the final project/assignment, projects/assignments
        are due at the start of class on the date indicated in the Class
        Schedule. Projects/assignments received late will be marked 50% off if
        the assignment is not submitted by the stated date on the calendar.
        After the second week, no late assignment will be accepted. The final
        project will not be accepted late. No assignments will be accepted after
        the last class meeting of the quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
        No make-up tests or quizzes will be given unless prearranged.
        Prearranged is defined as: notifying the instructor of the inability to
        take the test or quiz before the scheduled time of the test or quiz.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must make up the missed test or quiz within an agreed upon amount of
        time, no more than one week.
      </p>
      <h3>V grades and I grades</h3>
      <p>
        V - An instructor-initiated withdrawal of a student. The final grade
        issued if an instructor initiates a class withdrawal before the end of
        the quarter, often in consultation with the student, or if a student
        enrolls in a class but never attends or stops attending class. A faculty
        member is under no obligation to grant an instructorinitiated
        withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
        I - The incomplete is given at the discretion of the instructor only
        when the student has done satisfactory work but could not, for some
        unavoidable reason, complete some part of the coursework or take the
        final examination. The student and instructor prepare and sign an
        “Incomplete Grade Contract” (located in division offices) specifying the
        work to be completed. The contract will include the date by which all
        work must be submitted and the grade that will be submitted if the work
        is not completed. Incompletes given prior to Fall Quarter of 1990 will
        be assigned letter grades.

      <h2>Course Policies</h2>
      <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
      <p>
        I will not tolerate cheating. Grades on assignments, quizzes or tests
        will be adjusted as warranted. Students who are suspected to have
        cheated will have a private talk with me and/or the division director.
        During or after this discussion we may make a suitable adjustment, if
        circumstances seem to warrant it. The following list is a sample of
        items that I consider to be cheating, but is not a complete list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any assignment OR test which is copied in whole or in part from
          another person.
        </li>
        <li>Plagiarism (please be sure that you know what this means).</li>
        <li>Using corrected exams to study for late test taking.</li>
        <li>Use of past test to study for test taking.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Attendance</h3>
      <p>
        {' '}
        Because this is a mixed course, your "class participation" is your
        Discussion Board contributions. Generally there is a topic to be
        discussed each week of the course. The topics covered in this course can
        be difficult and require your attention and diligence. You should check
        in on the course at least 3 times a week, to be sure that you don't miss
        any important announcements or information. 10% of your grade is based
        upon your participation within this course.
      </p>
      <h3>Services for students with Disabilities</h3>
      <p>
        If you require an accommodation for a disability, please contact
        Services for Students with Disabilities at MLT 159, 425.640.1320
        orssdmail@edcc.edu
      </p>
      <h3>Student civility code and online etiquette expectations</h3>
      <p>
        I expect that students will conduct themselves in accordance with the
        Student Civility Code. The goal of the Student Civility Code is to
        improve the way Edmonds Community College educates students in the
        values of personal responsibility, consideration for others, and mutual
        respect in the presence of difference and disagreement. This means that
        everyone (students and faculty) should engage in courteous discourse -
        verbal and non-verbal, electronic and written. The primary way that
        communication will take place in our class is through email, discussions
        and assignment feedback. I will always communicate with you in a
        respectful manner and my expectation is that you will communicate with
        me and your classmates in the same way.
